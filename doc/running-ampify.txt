Running Ampify
==============

**Note: THIS DOES NOT WORK YET!**

Assuming that you've successfully built all the dependencies according to `the
building Ampify instructions <building-ampify.html>`_, you should now
be all set to run Ampify. |contents|

.. contents::   Table of Contents

                :backlinks: none

Unfortunately, there are a number of different components involved (redis,
node.js, ampnodes, etc.). And unless you're used to modern "high-scalability"
deployments in other contexts, it could all be quite a head fuck. Therefore, the
``amp`` script is provided to help ease the pain.

.. raw:: html

  <hr class="clear" />


Quickstart
----------

Assuming you want to call your Ampify instance ``kickass``, run:

.. syntax:: bash

    $ amp init kickass
    $ amp run kickass

And then, assuming you'd chosen the default port settings, point your browser
at:

* https://localhost:9040

Tada!


Initialising A New Instance
---------------------------

The ``amp init`` command is used to create a completely new instance. So, if you
want to create an instance called ``kickass``, you'd create it with:

.. syntax:: bash

    $ amp init kickass

The layout of the instance directory would look something like::

    kickass/
        .git/
        .gitignore
        README.md
        amprun.yaml
        ampnode/
            ampnode.yaml
            assetgen.yaml
            certs/
            redis.data.conf
            redis.live.conf
            services/
            templates/
            www/
        deployment.yaml

It will be created as a sibling directory to wherever you'd checked out the
ampify repo. That is, if the ampify repo had been checked out into::

    /home/tav/repo/ampify

Then the new ``kickass`` instance will be at::

    /home/tav/repo/kickass

The are two reasons for this. First of all, the various commands tend towards a
"`convention over configuration
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration>`_" approach and
many files are symlinked using relative paths. Secondly, using symlinks helps
keep various files in sync without too much hassle.

Now when you run ``amp init``, it will ask you various questions and will use
your answers to create the relevant files — just hit enter to use the default
values for the questions.

Most of the files can be easily re-created. And you can even over-write the
files in an existing instance, e.g.

.. syntax:: bash

    $ amp init kickass --clobber

This will freshly re-create the various files as if you'd run init for the first
time. It'd leave other files alone though. This is useful to keep up with any
changes that might be available in the ampify repository.

However, 6 of the generated files are special and will not be clobbered. These
contain public/private/control keys for you and your instance::

    ampnode/certs/user-<id>.control.key
    ampnode/certs/user-<id>.private.key
    ampnode/certs/user-<id>.public.key
    ampnode/certs/host-<id>.control.key
    ampnode/certs/host-<id>.private.key
    ampnode/certs/host-<id>.public.key

The public key components will have been signed by ``amphub.org`` and you'd have
been given unique user and instance ID numbers when you first ran ``amp init``.

You can share the public keys and ID numbers, but the private and control keys
must be kept safe and private. The control keys in particular are used to update
your keys with ``amphub.org`` — never share it!

And, finally, ``amp init`` will have automatically setup a git repository in the
instance directory. You might want to push this to a private GitHub repo (or
equivalent) for both backup and collaboration purposes.

The control keys will not be checked into this repo and are excluded via
``.gitignore`` — you should back them up separately and securely.


Running Your Instance
---------------------

Once you have an instance setup, you can use ``amp run`` to run all the
components at once, e.g. to run the above ``kickass``, you'd:

.. syntax:: bash

    $ amp run kickass

Behind the scenes, this would start up a bunch of different processes:

* keyspace node (running in single mode)
* redis servers
* ampnode instances

And, assuming that you'd chosen the default port settings, you should now be
able to point your browser at the following URL and login:

* https://localhost:9040

The various log, pid and related files for these processes will be within the
``amprun_root_directory`` setting as specified in your ``amprun.yaml`` file and
defaults to::

    /opt/ampify/var/

When you run ``amp init`` it might run commands via sudo to fix the directory
permissions. You can do this yourself by doing something like:

.. syntax:: bash

    $ sudo mkdir /opt/ampify
    $ sudo chown your-username /opt/ampify

By default, the ``amp run`` process daemonises itself. You can suppress this
with the ``--no-daemon`` parameter — allowing you to kill all the processes with
a single ^C.

Otherwise, you can stop or force quit a running set of processes, e.g.

.. syntax:: bash

    $ amp run kickass stop
    $ amp run kickass quit

You can also enable debug mode settings, e.g.

.. syntax:: bash

    $ amp run kickass --debug

This also implicitly sets the ``--no-daemon`` parameter.

By default, your instance will communicate with ``amphub.org`` so that other
instances can know how to contact you. You can disable this:

.. syntax:: bash

    $ amp run kickass --no-hub

However, until amp routing is developed, other nodes will not be able to contact
you if your address changes and you're in this mode. It can, however, be quite
useful whilst you're developing though.

And, on a related front, the ``amp`` run will try to figure out your
public/external IP address and establish a port mapping with any NAT device that
might be in between your machine and the internet. You can disable this, e.g.

.. syntax:: bash

    $ amp run kickass --no-nat-bypass

This setting is also implicit in the command that you'd use to run an instance
on a "proper" server or VPS:

.. syntax:: bash

    $ amp run kickass --server

This mode differs from the default (which is suited for normal single-machine
instances), in that it'd only start the following processes:

* redis servers
* ampnode instances

It assumes that you've got stable Keyspace servers running.


Server/Cloud Deployment
-----------------------

Until Amp Routing is developed, there's no built-in support to let other
instances provide offline replication. So, in order to run an instance which is
accessible when you're offline, you're going to have to deploy to a server with
decent internet connectivity.

This is easy enough when you've got just a single server but becomes quite
problematic once you have anything more than 2 servers. So, to help with the
problem, the ``amp deploy`` command tries to simplify things:

.. syntax:: bash

    $ amp deploy kickass

This will first generate tarballs of specific directories from your ampify and
instance repositories. This step requires clean working directories, so either
commit or ``git stash`` your changes first.

It will then communicate to the various ``username@hosts/ips`` that you've
specified in your ``deployment.yaml`` file. This will happen over SSH, so you
need SSH running on your machines and have the respective SSH keys.

You can limit deployment to specific hosts with:
 
.. syntax:: bash

    $ amp deploy kickass --host tav@212.4.3.2

You can also use an alternative file instead of ``deployment.yaml``, e.g.

.. syntax:: bash

    $ amp deploy kickass --config ~/path/to/alt.yaml

The ``amp deploy`` will try to find out if there's an existing deployment, and
if it's previously generated a tarball matching those versions, it'd create a
compressed diff to send — otherwise, it'd transfer over the full tarball.

And, finally, it'd run through a series of commands in order to switch over all
of your servers in a synchronised manner:

* runs the ``pre_deploy`` script if you'd specified one
* builds new tarballs if remote architecture differs
* double-verifies tarballs/patches in case of memory corruption
* extracts and sets up the updated directories
* runs host-specific ``pre_update`` scripts if you'd specified any
* tells the frontend to serve a placeholder "being upgraded" page
* runs ``amp run stop`` for any existing contexts
* switches over symlinks
* reloads the frontend — upgrading to a new binary on the fly
* launches ``amp run`` in the new deployment
* tells the frontend to go back to serving requests as normal
* cleans up all but the most recent of any previous deployments
* runs the ``post_deploy`` script if you'd specified one

The directory layout on your servers would end up looking something like::

    opt/
        ampify/
            dist/
                .current
                .previous
                ampify/
                ampify-4f59ef0205/
                ampify-bf7663914a/
                instance/
                instance-5ec279ee02/
                instance-21e1bfc4f7/
                lock-file
                patches/
            var/

Now, the mechanism used by ``amp deploy`` is far from perfect. It is not robust
against your servers failing and it wouldn't scale beyond 100 or so servers.

A far better solution, ``redpill``, has already been designed and it'll be
implemented as part of the Ampify development. It'll allow for scalable,
failure-tolerant, synchronised updates and multi-version deployment.

But, for now, ``amp deploy`` is all we have.


Customising Your Instance
-------------------------

You can create custom services and modify the templates by changing the files
inside your instance's ``ampnode`` directory. Be sure to update the
``ampnode.yaml`` config file with the modules for any new services you define.


Cheatsheet
----------

Be sure to also try out ``amp help``.

.. syntax:: bash

    $ amp init <instance-name>    # initialise a new setup
    $ amp run <instance-name>     # run all the components
    $ amp deploy <instance-name>  # deploy to remote hosts

e.g.

.. syntax:: bash

  # Create a new branch for your patch:
  $ git checkout -b name-for-your-patch

  # Make the various changes you want to make and
  # submit it to be to be reviewed by running:
  $ git review submit

  # Make any changes and submit updates until the
  # reviewers give a LGTM (Looks Good To Me) reply
  # on http://gitreview.com -- that's all!
