Hosting
-------

✓ Investigate cloud service providers.

  Choosing good hosting provider(s) is going to be important for the long-term
  success of Ampify. Unfortunately the current set of cloud services do not seem
  to be spectacularly attractive choices.

  Services like `Amazon EC2 <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/>`_ are impressive from a
  technical perspective. For example, Amazon's Elastic Load Balancer makes what
  would otherwise be a pretty painful experience quite effortless.

  However, on the flip side, the abstractions also introduces a lot of
  additional complexities to manage. This is most notable with the case of >
  Amazon's `Elastic Block Store <http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/>`_. Writing a file
  to disk now involves half a dozen support structures!

  Cloud offerings also make very little sense from a financial perspective. Not
  only do comparable "raw metal" servers cost substantially less, but you also
  get a noticeable increase in raw performance.

  And, finally, multi-tenancy introduces a host of `novel security
  considerations <http://people.csail.mit.edu/tromer/papers/cloudsec.pdf>`_.
  Server management is complicated enough without having to worry about these
  and other gaming issues.

✓ Investigate dedicated server providers.

  `Hostway <http://www.hostway.com/dedicated-servers/>`_ seem to have quite a
  competitive offering with offers of good support and 100% uptime. The global
  distribution (North America, Europe, East Asia) of their data centers is also
  quite attractive with regards future expansion.

  Of the other providers, `Terremark <http://www.terremark.com>`_ looks quite
  impressive, but do not seem to be affordable at a small scale. `Codero
  <http://www.codero.com>`_ (USA) and `Hetzner <http://www.hetzner.de>`_
  (Germany) are attractive price-wise, however they don't seem to be too
  reliable with regards network connectivity.

✗ Investigate/negotiate deal with Hostway.

  There are a number of issues to verify:

  * What's their process for scheduled maintenance? Do they have an IRC channel
    for live support?

    * They don't have an IRC channel, but do offer 24x7 support and ticketing
      system.

  * What are their limitations with regards to provisioning new servers? At what
    rate can they handle orders for new servers?

    * They can deploy new servers (from any of their default configs) within 24
      hours, which could potentially be rushed. Custom configurations would take
      longer though.

  * What are our options about deploying across their `various data centers
    <http://www.hostway.com/infrastructure/>`_? What is the latency between
    these locations?

    * We can choose which data centers to deploy to.

  * Do they offer ECC RAM on their servers? What kind specifically?

    * Yes, the RAM on the servers we've been looking at is DDR3 ECC.

  * Do they offer servers with Gigabit NIC? This will be quite important for the
    frontend servers.

    * All servers are fitted with Gigabit NICs.

  * What happens when servers exceed their allocated 2TB bandwidth? Is "internal"
    bandwidth charged for? What about across their data centers?

    * Excess bandwidth is charged for. We can prebuy various bandwidth plans.
      And with regards internal traffic, we can arrange for our servers to be
      setup on a private switch.

  * Do they offer static IP addresses? What's their process for allocation of new
    address blocks?

  Tav is currently engaged in a dialogue with Jamie Fryer from Hostway.
