Ampify
======

Ampify is a vision of an open and decentralised application platform. For
comparison, perhaps imagine a bastardised mix between Git, Facebook, Unix, IRC,
App Engine, Xanadu and Wikis.

The goal for the final 1.0 release is to have a fully decentralised "internet
operating system" style platform. We're currently working towards an initial
release, ``Ampify Zero``, for the end of this year -- `see the planfile
<planfile.html>`_ for more info.


Get Started With Ampify Development
-----------------------------------

You need to have `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_, a Unix-like OS, a bash shell, a
recent Python 2.x and general dev tools (gcc, make, etc.) installed.

.. syntax:: bash

  $ git clone https://github.com/tav/ampify.git # (1)
  $ cd ampify
  $ make                                        # (2)
  $ export PATH=`pwd`/environ:$PATH             # (3)
  $ amp init kickass                            # (4)
  $ amp run kickass                             # (5)
  $ open https://localhost:8040                 # (6)

1. Clone the repository. You need to have Git 1.7+ in order to use the smart
   HTTP protocol.

2. Running ``make`` builds various dependencies like Keyspace, Node.js, compiles
   CoffeeScript/Sass files and minifies the resulting JavaScript/CSS files. All
   builds are self-contained within the ``environ/local`` sub-directory that
   will be automatically created.

   You can run ``make clean`` to remove everything except the built
   dependencies, which you can also remove using the full ``make distclean``. Be
   sure to re-run ``make`` after you do a git pull or update -- this will keep
   the generated files up-to-date.

   Please note that running ``make`` for the first time currently takes around
   20 minutes, so you might want to grab something to drink and do something
   else like read `HN <http://news.ycombinator.com/>`_ or `xkcd
   <http://xkcd.com/>`_ -- with an eye on your terminal for any errors that
   might occur.

3. By extending your ``$PATH`` to include the ``environ`` directory, a number of
   new commands will now be available to you -- including the core ``amp``
   command. You might want to add this to your ``~/.bashrc`` file or equivalent.

   So if you'd cloned the repository into ``/home/tav/ampify``, then you would
   add the following line to your ``~/.bashrc`` file:

   .. syntax:: bash

     export PATH=/home/tav/ampify/environ:$PATH

4. This last step points you to the `Running Ampify Zero
   <running-ampify-zero.html>`_ document. As it states, Ampify Zero doesn't work
   yet, but it goes into detail of how an instance is meant to be setup and run.

   You first initialise an instance using the ``amp`` utility script. This asks
   you a few questions and generates the appropriate files in a sibling
   directory to your Ampify repository. So, if you wanted to create an instance
   called ``kickass``, you'd:

   .. syntax:: bash

     $ amp init kickass

   Then, you'd run the various component processes of Ampify Zero with:

   .. syntax:: bash

     $ amp run kickass

   Do read the `Running Ampify Zero <running-ampify-zero.html>`_ doc for more
   info.

  `fork <http://help.github.com/forking/>`_ the `ampify repository
  <http://github.com/tav/ampify>`_ and send `pull requests
  <http://github.com/guides/pull-requests>`_ with any changes you might have.

.. syntax:: bash

  $ git clone git@github.com:yourUsername/ampify.git
  $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/tav/ampify.git

* Read the `getting started with git
  <http://www.espians.com/getting-started-with-git.html>`_ guide for Ampify
  Developers if you're new to git.

* Familiarise yourself with the Ampify testing and review process.

.. syntax:: bash

  # commit your changes to your local repository.
  $ git commit

  # submit an issue to be reviewed on
  # http://codereview.appspot.com — running this also
  # checks with appropriate local revhooks before your
  # submission is made.
  $ git review submit 

  # make any changes and keep committing and submitting
  # updates on the issue until the reviewers give a
  # LGTM (Looks Good To Me) reply.

  # once you have an okay, squash your various commits
  # into a single commit and push to the remote
  # repository.
  $ git review push

* Have fun!
